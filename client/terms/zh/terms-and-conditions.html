        <h3>Additional Terms</h3>
        <p>
            Some of our Services may have additional terms and conditions (&ldquo;Additional Terms&rdquo;). Where
            Additional Terms apply to a Service, we will make them available for you to read through your use of that
            Service. By using a Service subject to Additional Terms, you agree to those Additional Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>Responsible Gaming</h3>

        <p>
            As a responsible community member, EOSTime is committed to promoting responsible gambling practices. We
            firmly believe that public awareness and education is key in this effort.
        </p>

        <h3>Characteristics of Responsible Gaming</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsible gamblers understand that gambling by its nature entails risk and that the odds of
                winning are with the house.
            </li>
            <li>Responsible gaming is done socially, with family, friends or colleagues.</li>
            <li>Responsible gaming is done for limited amounts of time, both in frequency and duration.</li>
            <li>Responsible gaming always has pre determined, acceptable limits for losses.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Know your personal limits</h3>

        <p>
            You can establish your own limits and provide direction to others by developing a set of personal
            guidelines to determine whether, when and how much to gamble. The decision to gamble is a personal
            choice. No one should feel pressure to gamble, or feel that he or she must gamble to be accepted.
            Gambling is not essential for having a good time. Gambling should not be perceived as necessary for
            having fun and being with friends.

        <p>
            What constitutes an acceptable loss needs to be established before starting to gamble. Any money spent
            on gambling should be considered the cost of entertainment; people should only gamble with money they
            can afford to lose. For those who choose to gamble, it is essential to know when to stop.
        </p>


        <p>
            Borrowing money to gamble should be avoided and discouraged. Borrowing money from a friend, relative or
            any other source of funds with the intention of repaying with gambling winnings is always high risk and
            inappropriate. There are times when people should not gamble. Never gamble when under the legal gambling
            age; when it interferes with work or family responsibilities; when in recovery for addictive disorders
            or dependencies; when the form of gambling is illegal; when gambling is prohibited by organizational
            policy; or when trying to make up for prior gambling losses (“chasing” losses).
        </p>


        <p>
            There are certain high-risk situations during which gambling should be avoided. Avoid gambling when
            feeling lonely, angry, depressed or under stress; when coping with the death of a loved one; to solve
            personal or family problems; or to impress others.
        </p>

        <p>
            Excessive use of alcohol when gambling can be risky. Irresponsible alcohol use can affect a person's
            judgment and interfere with the ability to control gambling and adhere to predetermined limits.
        </p>


        <p>
            Keep gambling what it should be -- entertainment. Know how to set limits, and most importantly, know when
            to stop.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, contact <A href="http://www.gamblersanonymous.org/">Gamblers
            Anononymous</A>.

        <h3>Resolution of Disputes; Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
            These Terms, any Additional Terms, and any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms, the
            Additional
            Terms or the provision or use of the Service, shall be governed exclusively by, and construed in
            accordance
            with the laws of the United States and the State of Massachusetts, without reference to any conflict
            of laws
            principles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms (or the interpretation,
            performance, or breach of them), the Site or the Services, including but not limited to alleged
            violations
            of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;) shall be
            solely and
            exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If we are unable to
            resolve
            any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute.
            The
            arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to the JAMS/Endispute Comprehensive
            Arbitration Rules
            and Procedures in effect as of the date hereof, including the Optional Appeal Procedure provided for
            in such
            rules (the &ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;). The arbitration shall be conducted in Suffolk County,
            Massachusetts, before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration
            Rules. The
            arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by these Terms and any of the other agreements between us,
            including any applicable Additional Terms, and may be enforced in any court of competent
            jurisdiction. No
            Disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. Arbitration can decide only the
            individual
            Dispute and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who
            may be
            similarly situated. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY
            HAVE TO
            JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE. ANY
            CLAIMS
            ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THESE TERMS MUST BE ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY. The
            arbitrator
            shall not have the power to award punitive damages against any party.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Provisions</h3>

            Under no circumstances will CryptoSports, Inc. be held liable for any delay or failure in
            performance due in
            whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond its reasonable control.
        </p>
        <p>
            If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision
            will be
            deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any
            remaining
            provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The failure of CryptoSports, Inc. to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent
            CryptoSports, Inc. from enforcing such right or provision in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger,
            acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of law.
